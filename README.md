# Predict of wins in the Olympics.

My name is Kartal. I graduated as a biochemichal engineer and want to combine my knowledge with machine learning technology. This is a step to me to reach this goal.
This is my fist attempt to make a machine learning program.
I make this program based on this video:

I am going to use python 3.11 and pycharm, more over I am going to upload it to GitHub so anyone can follow my progress.

Project proces:
1. Form a hypothesis. (We can prove or disprove using data)
We can predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics.
2. Find the Data.
3. Reshape the Data.
4. Clean the Data
5. Error Metric.
6. Split the Data. (Training and Test Data)
7. Train a Model. (Linear Regression)
